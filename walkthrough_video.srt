In this video we conduct a walktrough of the Attack Graph Generator.

2
00:00:02.01 --> 00:00:04.00
The program is automatically initialized after the installation process.

3
00:00:04.01 --> 00:00:06.00
First, topology parsing is performed.

4
00:00:06.01 --> 00:00:08.00
Then, the docker images are built. This part should take some time.

5
00:00:08.01 --> 00:00:10.00
Parts of this video are intentionally skipped, in order to reduce waiting time.

5
00:00:12.01 --> 00:00:14.00
Postgres, Clair and Clairctl are pulled and started.

6
00:00:20.01 --> 00:00:22.00
The images are pushed to Clair and analyzed for vulnerabilities.

7
00:00:22.01 --> 00:00:24.00
We can notice that no vulnerabilities are detected for these images.

8
00:00:24.01 --> 00:00:26.00
After the vulnerabilities are extracted, the attack graph generation is started.

9
00:00:30.01 --> 00:00:32.00
The attack graph generation is finished.

10
00:00:32.01 --> 00:00:34.00
No vulnerabilities were detected because Clair needs

11
00:00:34.01 --> 00:00:36.00
some time to populate the database with known vulnerabilities.

12
00:00:36.01 --> 00:00:38.00
We recommend waiting for couple of hours and starting the program again.

13
00:00:38.01 --> 00:00:40.00
Now, let us see the folder structure.

14
00:00:44.01 --> 00:00:46.00
The folder examples contains the Docker Compose systems.

15
00:00:52.01 --> 00:00:55.00
Inside the javaee system, we can see the file called docker-compose.yml

16
00:01:00.01 --> 00:01:03.00
This file describes the connections between different containers.

17
00:01:10.01 --> 00:01:13.00
The config file contains the user-defined settings and

17
00:01:13.01 --> 00:01:16.00
the precondition and postcondition rules

18
00:01:16.01 --> 00:01:19.00
required for the attack graph generation process.

19
00:01:30.01 --> 00:01:33.00
examples-results contains the produced files from the attack graph generation.

20
00:01:35.01 --> 00:01:38.00
Here, we observe the resulting topology graph.

21
00:01:40.01 --> 00:01:42.00
The attack graph is empty because Clair did not detect vulnerabilities.

22
00:01:42.01 --> 00:01:44.00
The vulnerabilities report file generated by Clair.

23
00:01:44.01 --> 00:01:46.00
This was a short summary of the attack graph generator setup and run.

24
00:01:46.01 --> 00:01:48.00

25
00:01:48.01 --> 00:01:50.00
Thank you for your attention.
