Hello. In this video we demonstrate

1
00:00:02.01 --> 00:00:04.00
how to install the Attack Graph Generator.

2
00:00:04.01 --> 00:00:07.00
We first enter the directory where the program is saved.

3
00:00:13.01 --> 00:00:15.00
We then enter the command for starting the program.

4
00:00:15.01 --> 00:00:17.00
The program has to run in sudo mode.

5
00:00:17.01 --> 00:00:19.00
Once the program is started, it automatically

6
00:00:19.01 --> 00:00:21.00
downloads and installs the needed third-party components

7
00:00:21.01 --> 00:00:23.00
needed for the program to run properly.

8
00:00:23.01 --> 00:00:25.00
The user should press Y and Enter couple of times

9
00:00:25.01 --> 00:00:27.00
to allow the components to be installed on the host machine.

10
00:00:27.01 --> 00:00:29.00
The installation process should last couple of minutes.

11
00:00:29.01 --> 00:00:31.00
Some of the parts in this video are intentionally skipped,

12
00:00:31.01 --> 00:00:33.00
in order to reduce waiting time.

13
00:00:33.01 --> 00:00:35.00
Some of the third-party components include:

14
00:00:35.01 --> 00:00:37.00
python, pip, docker, docker-compose, go,

15
00:00:37.01 --> 00:00:39.00
clairctl, graphviz, pyyaml, networkx and the examples.

16
00:01:39.01 --> 00:01:41.00
Once all of the third-party components are downloaded and installed,

17
00:01:41.01 --> 00:01:43.00
the attack graph generation procedure is automatically initialized.

18
00:01:43.01 --> 00:01:45.00
For a walkthrough of running the program, please watch the second video.

19
00:01:45.01 --> 00:01:47.00
Thank you for your attention.
