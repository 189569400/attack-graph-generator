\section{BACKGROUND}

In this section we start by formally defining attack graphs and their characteristics (Subsection \ref{chap:attack_graphs}). Afterwards we look into microservices, their advantages in comparison to monolithic systems and conclude with their security implications (Subsection \ref{chap:microservices}).
