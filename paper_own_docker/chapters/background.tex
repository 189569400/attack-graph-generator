\section{BACKGROUND}

In this section we start by introducing the concept of microservices, their benefits and security implications (Subsection \ref{chap:microservices}). Afterwards we look into vulnerability scanners as tools to generate vulnerabilities of a single host (Subsection \ref{chap:vulnerability_scanners}). At the end we introduce and formally describe attack graphs as methods to disagnose security weakness of a given system composed of multiple hosts (Subsection \ref{chap:attack_graphs}).
