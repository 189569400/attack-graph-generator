Microservices, in contrast to monolithic systems, provide an architecture that is modular and easily scalable. This advantage has resulted in a rapid increase in usage of microservices in recent years. Despite their rapid increase in popularity, there is a lack of work that focuses of their security aspect. Therefore, in the following paper, we present a novel Breath-first Search (BFS) based method for attack graph generation and security analysis of microservice architectures using Docker and Clair.
