\subsection{Vulnerability Scanners}
\label{chap:vulnerability_scanners}

This rise in communication makes it crucial data to be transferred and stored securely. Vulnerability scanners try to tackle this issue in computer networks by scanning a single host and generating a list of exploitable vulnerabilities \cite{deraison1999nessus}\cite{farmer1990cops}\cite{clair}. However, since many attacks are networks based and performed in multiple steps through a network, more sophisticated approach is needed. As a result a combination of vulnerability scanner and topology is seen as a promising solution to this problem in previous work \cite{sheyner2002automated}\cite{ingols2006practical}
