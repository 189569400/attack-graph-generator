\subsection{Vulnerability Scanners}
\label{chap:vulnerability_scanners}

 A vulnerability is a system weakness that could be exploited by a malicious actor with the help of an appropriate suite of tools. Many vulnerabilities are publicly known (CVE) and organized in databases like (NVD). CVE\footnote{\url{https://cve.mitre.org/}} is a list of publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities where each entry contains an identification number, a description, and at least one public reference. This list of publicly known vulnerabilities is organized in the  NVD\footnote{\url{https://nvd.nist.gov/}} repository that enables automation of vulnerability management, security measurement, and compliance \cite{booth2013national}. Vulnerability scanners try to detect weaknesses by scanning a single host and generating a list of exploitable vulnerabilities \cite{deraison1999nessus, farmer1990cops}. However, since many attacks are network-based and performed in multiple steps through a network, more sophisticated approaches are required. Therefore a combination of vulnerability scanner and topology is seen as a promising solution to this problem in previous work \cite{sheyner2002automated, ingols2006practical}.
