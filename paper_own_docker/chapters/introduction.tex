\section{INTRODUCTION}

Attack graphs are a popular way of examining security aspects of network. They help security analysts to carefully analyse a system connection and detect the most vulnerable parts of the system. An attack graph depicts the actions that an attacker uses in order to reach his goal.  

Statistics. They do not offer any performance comparison between different topologies. 

We first have a look into the work of other (Section 2), then present the architecure of our system (Section 3), test the scalability (Section 4) and at the end provide a conclusion (Section 5) and future work (Section 6).
